### Chidinma Nze

Web developer with a certificate in full-stack web development from Michigan State University. With a background in graphic design and communications, I strive to create intuitive solutions for end users. I do this by always keeping an eye on the big picture while Iâ€™m in the development process. I work well with UI/UX designers because I understand their point of view. My specialty is HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I. Iâ€™ve been able to successfully learn a completely new skill set, with constant improvement. To get to this point, Iâ€™ve invested many hours dedicated to learning in class and on my own, and Iâ€™m determined to keep learning and growing my skills. By the end of my coding bootcamp in November 2020, I will have learned the MERN stack, (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js).
